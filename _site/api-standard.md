# API Standard for Fiscal Services

### 1. Overivew
	
This guide documents the framework used to develop APIs for Fiscal Service.  The framework should be used by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for all public-facing APIs.  This provides consistency to the public user and allows APIs to be consolidated into a common portal. This version (v.1) contains elements that are still under development and may be subject to change as Fiscal Service continues to evaluate use of APIs.

### 2. API Framework

The API framework is used to define the layout of the URL, input parameters, and the response.  The framework defined within this document provides a consistent experience for the Fiscal Service API user.

### 2.1 URL Layout and Taxonomy
The URLs should be formatted with all characters in lower case and separated by underscores (e.g. fiscal_service).  All endpoints will be singular case.  All requests will be HTTP GET requests.  The URL of an API is broken down into the following components:

Organization: The organization component of the API URL reflects the bureau that is creating the API.

`(e.g. https://api.transparency.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service)`

Version: Integer version number for the release of the API.  This is only changed when a revision will affect the underlying behavior of the request/response.Backward compatible changes will not result in a new version number.  APIs may incorporate a ‘default version’ that automatically uses the newest version of the API if none is specified.

`(e.g. https://api.transparency.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v1)`

Subject Area: The subject area represents the business area within the organization for the API.  The subject areas, as defined for the API,  for the Fiscal Service are:

1. 	debt
2. 	payments
3.	collections
4.	accounting
5.	securities
	
`(e.g. https://api.transparency.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v1/debt)`

Topic/Sub Topic: After the subject area the API endpoint can end with a topic or have a number of sub topics.  The topic references the specific set of data within the hierarchy that the user is looking to query.

`(e.g. https://api.transparency.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v1/debt/tror)`

or 

`https://api.transparency.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v1/debt/tror/analytics_collection_delinquent_debt)`

### 2.2 Input Parameters

API input parameters are designed with the end user in mind.  They are structured for consistency across APIs.  The parameters are separated into the following:  fields, filter, sorting, query (future release), pretty print (future release), format, and pagination.

### 2.2.1 Fields

1.	Definition:  Field parameter accepts a comma separated list of field names that the user wants to be returned in the response.

5.	Default Value: Default to all fields if not provided
6. 	Example: 
[https://api.transparency.treasury.gov/services/api/.../delinquent_debt?fields=funding_type_id,delinquency_rate_amount,debt_by_category_count](https://api.transparency.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v1/debt/tror/delinquent_debt?fields=funding_type_id,delinquency_rate_amount,debt_by_category_count).
